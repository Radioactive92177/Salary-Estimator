# Salary Estimator

Here is a **Business Intelligence tool** which can help you set **salary** for your **new employee** based on the salaries of your **existing employees**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Salary Estimator works on the principle of **Linear Regression**.
> Thus only works with ***Linear Data*** i.e. *one X and one Y only*.

## Steps to Get it Working

1. Install the dependencies **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**

2. Run the app **`python app.py`**

3. Give **path** to your company dataset

4. Choose if you want to see the graph **(y/n)**

5. Tell the field you want to predict **(Salary or Years of Experience)**

6. You get an **Estimated Salary** based on your data

> [!NOTE]
> The current version of the app is only **console based**.
> We do intend to make a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI) for the application.
> Any contribution is **highly appreciated**
